Blood tests can measure total T4, free T4, total T3, or free T3. The total T4 test has been used for many years, but it can be affected by the amount of protein available in the blood to bind to the hormone. Free T4 is not affected by protein levels and is the active form of thyroxine. The free T4 test is thought by many to be a more accurate reflection of thyroid hormone function and, in most cases, its use has replaced that of the total T4 test.\r\n\r\nThe free or total T3 test is usually ordered following an abnormal TSH, particularly if the free T4 test is not elevated."

      "Who_is_it_for": "Laboratory testing is not diagnostic for hypertension, but tests are frequently ordered to detect conditions that may cause and/or make high blood pressure worse and to evaluate and monitor organ function over time. Lipid profile in this panel is used to evaluate levels of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and assess the risk of developing atherosclerosis.\r\n\r\nThere are many other tests other than mentioned above in the panel, that may be ordered to evaluate underlying causes of hypertension. These are as follow:\r\n\r\n1. Urinary albumin (microalbumin), BUN (blood urea nitrogen), creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) â€“ to detect and monitor kidney dysfunction or to monitor the effect of medications on the kidneys\r\n\r\n2. Potassium â€“ as part of the electrolyte panel, which also includes sodium, chloride, and carbon dioxide (CO2); to evaluate and monitor the balance of the body's electrolytes. For example, low potassium can be seen in Cushing syndrome and Conn syndrome, two causes of secondary hypertension. Some high blood pressure medications can upset electrolyte balance by causing excessive loss of potassium or potassium retention.\r\n\r\n3. Calcium â€“ to determine how much total calcium or ionized calcium is circulating in the blood; increased activity of the parathyroid glands, which produces an increase in serum calcium, is associated with hypertension.\r\n\r\n4. TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) and T4 â€“ to detect and monitor thyroid dysfunction.\r\n\r\n5. HBA1c is used to monitor glucose control over time in people with diabetes\r\n\r\nThe basic metabolic panel (BMP) includes several of the tests listed above, so it may be ordered instead of the individual tests."

Screening tests include self-checks, clinical exams, non-laboratory tests (such as imaging tests), and laboratory tests. The focus here is on laboratory screening tests and other tests and conditions related to men's health. It's easy to take these tests for granted, but their power to keep you healthier longer should not be underestimated.\r\n\r\nGetting routine tests performed even though you have no symptoms can help detect problems early and help you benefit from easier and more effective treatment. It can sometimes even prevent disease. It's easy to take these tests for granted, but their power to keep you healthier longer should not be underestimated."
