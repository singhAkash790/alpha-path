            "question": "What are Allergies?",
            "answer": " <p>Allergies occur when the body responds to a foreign protein. Usually, these proteins, known as allergens, are not harmful.&nbsp;</p><p>Allergies can be different for everyone. Some people might just feel a bit uncomfortable, while others could have a really serious emergency called anaphylaxis, which needs quick attention.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Allergic Reaction:</strong> An allergic reaction is the way the body responds to an allergen. When someone has allergies, the first time they encounter a specific allergen, their body responds by making immunoglobulin E (IgE). The immune system creates antibodies, and these antibodies form IgE in response to the allergen.&nbsp;</p> "

There are three types of skin allergy tests.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Skin prick test</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>This is also known as the scratch test, where the suspected allergen is placed on the back or forearm, and the site is pricked so that the allergen enters the body system.&nbsp;</p><p>The doctor then observes the skin area closely for any reactions. The test is done for multiple suspected allergens at once. In such cases, the procedure is carried out on multiple skin points using the different suspected allergens.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to note that this test isn’t solely for testing skin allergies. If one suspects a food allergy, a skin prick test can also be used for food allergy testing. The doctor introduces a liquid that contains protein from the suspected food into the body through a prick. If one is allergic to food, there will be reactions at the test site.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Intradermal test</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>In the intradermal test, doctors inject a small amount of the suspected allergen just under the skin, and the skin surface is observed for a few minutes for reactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Intradermal injections are mainly administered on the forearm, upper arm, or back. A positive test will result in swelling, redness, or an itch. This test is mainly used for testing penicillin and insect bite allergies.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Patch test</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>A patch test is another method of allergy testing involving the skin that is effective in identifying the causes of the allergy.&nbsp;</p><p>It does not involve needles. Instead, a patch embedded with several suspected allergens is attached to the skin. The person is required to wear the patch for up to 48 hours, and during this time it is suggested to avoid bathing or activities that will make a person sweat.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the 48 hours, the person should visit the doctor; the doctor then removes it and checks the results.&nbsp;</p><p>With a patch test, one can determine which skin allergy types they have. If a person reacts to any of the tested substances, that is the allergen, and they must avoid it.&nbsp;</p>"

            "answer": "<h4>Liver Function Test&nbsp;</h4><p>It is a group of tests that are performed together to detect, evaluate, and monitor liver disease or damage. The panel usually consists of several tests that are run at the same time on a blood sample. These include:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)&nbsp;</strong></p><p>An enzyme found mainly in liver tissue and to a lesser extent in the heart, kidney and skeletal muscle. Its measurement is clinically useful in the diagnosis of liver and biliary disease.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)</strong></p><p>An enzyme found in several parts of the body, including the heart, liver, and muscles. Since AST levels aren't as specific for liver damage as ALT, it's usually measured together with ALT to check for liver problems. When the liver is damaged, AST can be released into the blood stream. A high result on an AST test might indicate a problem with the liver or muscles.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Gamma Glutamyl Transpeptidase (GGTP) </strong>&nbsp;</p><p>An enzyme that is found in many organs throughout the body, with the highest concentrations found in the liver. GGT is elevated in the blood in most diseases that cause damage to the liver or bile ducts.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Bilirubin, Total</strong></p><p>It is used to detect an increased level of bilirubin in the blood. It helps to determine the cause of jaundice and diagnose conditions such as liver disease, haemolytic anaemia, and blockage of the bile ducts.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. Bilirubin, Direct</strong></p><p>It measures a form of bilirubin that is conjugated (combined with another compound) in the liver; It is only increased in the case of liver disease.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>6. Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>An enzyme related to the bile ducts but also produced by the bones, intestines, and during pregnancy by the placenta (after birth). High levels of ALP may indicate liver inflammation, blockage of the bile ducts, or bone disease.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>7. Albumin</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Albumin is the main protein made by the liver. This test measures the level of albumin in the blood. A low result indicates that the liver isn’t functioning properly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>8. Total Protein</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The total protein test measures the total amount of protein in the blood and specifically looks for the amount of albumin and globulin. It also measures the ratio of albumin to globulin in the blood known as the A/G ratio.&nbsp;<br>Total Protein is useful in evaluating patients for nutritional status, liver disease, protein losing renal and gastrointestinal diseases.</p><p><strong>9. Ammonia Test</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Ammonia Test is used to detect an elevated level of ammonia in the blood that may be caused by severe liver disease, kidney failure, or certain rare genetic disorders.</p><p><strong>10. Ceruloplasmin Test</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Ceruloplasmin is the major copper-carrying protein in the blood, and also plays a role in iron metabolism. Ceruloplasmin testing is used to help diagnose Wilson disease, an autosomal recessive disorder. Low levels may also occur in Menkes syndrome which is a genetic defect in copper .&nbsp;</p><p><strong>11. Bile Acids, Total&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Increases in serum bile acids may be a marker for acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, liver sclerosis, liver cancer, and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.</p><p><strong>12. NAFLD (Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease) Fibrosis Score</strong></p><p>It is a non-invasive scoring system based on several laboratory tests that help to estimate the amount of scarring in the liver.&nbsp;</p>"
